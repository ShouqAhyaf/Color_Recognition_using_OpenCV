# 🎯 Project : Color Recognition using OpenCV (Python)

## 📌 Requirements
### 💻 Software:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook (if running online)

## 🎯 How Color Recognition Works?
1. Loads an image and converts it to HSV color space.
2. Predefined color ranges are used to detect specific colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow).
3. The script highlights detected colors and labels them.
4. Displays the processed image with color names.

## OpenCV Color Recognition Issues
1. Ensure the image is not too dark or blurry.
2. Adjust the HSV color range to improve detection accuracy.
